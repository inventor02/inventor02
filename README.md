### Hi - I'm George

I currently work at the [University of Southampton](https://southampton.ac.uk) as a Software and Infrastructure Engineer primarily looking after Kubernetes and infrastructure automation tooling, CI/CD for the aforementioned and a bunch of other stuff.

I graduated from the University with a MEng Computer Science (First Class Honours) in 2025.
