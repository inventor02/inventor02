### Hi - I'm George

I currently work at the [University of Southampton](https://southampton.ac.uk/isolutions) as a Software and Infrastructure Engineer primarily looking after Kubernetes and infrastructure automation tooling, CI/CD for the aforementioned and a bunch of other stuff. I graduated from the University with a MEng Computer Science (First Class Honours) in 2025.

Outside of work I volunteer with [Southampton Robotics Outreach](https://roboticsoutreach.org) which is an organisation that aims to promote STEM education with young people through robotics.

Previously I have worked at [Orbx](https://orbx.group) as a DevOps Engineer and at [vAMSYS](https://vamsys.co.uk) as a Software and (later) Infrastructure Engineer.
