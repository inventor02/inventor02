### Hi - I'm George

I'm passionate about computers and how they work, and I like making things to help the communities I am in (or just for fun!)

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [vAMSYS](https://vamsys.co.uk), a community platform for flight simulation, and [curdle](https://github.com/inventor02/curdle), a word-guessing game (inspired by one that you might be able to guess) which I am working on with friends on my course
- 🎓 I'm currently studying an MEng degree in Computer Science at the [University of Southampton](https://ecs.soton.ac.uk), and I hold A levels in Computer Science, Physics and Mathematics
- 💻 Programming languages I know include C, C#, Java, Node.js, PHP, 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about graphics in C, using both OpenGL and SDL2
- ✈️ Outside of Computer Science, I am passionate about planes and trains (but no automobiles, I'm afraid)
- 🛒 I worked in the customer service team in a branch of a large chain supermarket, later going on to supervise the payment operation, for two years
