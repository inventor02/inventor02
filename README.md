### Hi - I'm George

I'm passionate about computers and how they work, and I like making things both to help the communities I am in and just for the hell of it!

- 🔨 I help to build [Volanta](https://volanta.app), the next-generation flight tracking app for flight simulation, at [Orbx](https://orbx.group)
- :car: I'm also on the [Southampton University Formula Student Team](https://sufst.co.uk) where I work in the team responsible for developing a GUI to adjust parameters of the vehicle control unit
- 🎓 I'm currently studying an MEng degree in Computer Science at the [University of Southampton](https://ecs.soton.ac.uk), and I hold A levels in Computer Science, Physics and Mathematics
- 💻 Programming languages I know include C, C#, VB.NET, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP and Haskell
- ⚒️ Experienced in Laravel, ASP.NET Core and Angular, and I love tinkering with embedded firmware for devices like the Pi Pico
- ✈️ Outside of Computer Science, I am passionate about planes and trains (but not automobiles, I'm afraid)
- 🛒 Worked as a payment supervisor in a large supermarket for two years
