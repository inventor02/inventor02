### Hi - I'm George

I'm passionate about computers and how they work, and I like making things both to help the communities I am in and just for the hell of it!

- 🔭 In my free time, I maintain infrastructure for [vAMSYS](https://vamsys.co.uk), a community platform for flight simulation, and work on some other side projects with my friends
- :car: I'm also on the [Southampton University Formula Student Team](https://sufst.co.uk) where I work in the team responsible for developing a GUI to adjust parameters of the vehicle control unit
- 🎓 I'm currently studying an MEng degree in Computer Science at the [University of Southampton](https://ecs.soton.ac.uk), and I hold A levels in Computer Science, Physics and Mathematics
- 💻 Programming languages I know include C, C#, VB.NET, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript and PHP
- ⚒️ Frameworks I have experience with include Laravel and ASP.NET Core
